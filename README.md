# Hey there! 👋🚀

I'm **Nick**, a Product Front-end Developer with a passion for turning designs into usable, scalable and clean user interfaces! 🎨💻  My journey started with curiosity for how websites are built and grew into **3+ years** of hands-on production experience delivering 200+ UI projects in real environments.


Here's a snapshot of my tech toolkit:
- Fluent in: **HTML** · **CSS** · **JavaScript** · **jQuery** · **PHP**
- Currently diving deep into: **React** · **Next.js** · **TypeScript** · **Tailwind** · **Headless CMS (Sanity)**
- Tooling & DX: ESLint · Prettier · Husky · lint-staged · Git/GitHub · Trello · Slack · Geekbot

## What I Bring to the Table:
- **Curiosity**: A never-ending quest for knowledge.
- **Creativity**: Innovative solutions to complex problems.
- **Collaboration**: Teamwork makes the dream work.
